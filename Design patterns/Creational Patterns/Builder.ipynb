    "## Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "**Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step by step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worst scattered all over the client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's think about how to create *House* object. To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger house, with a backyard and other goodies (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution is to extend the base *House* class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you'll end up with a considerable number of subclasess. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another approach that doesn't involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base *House* class with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The builder pattern suggest that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separete object called builders.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Class diagram](./images/builder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (buildWalls, buildDoor, etc). To create an object, you execute a series of theses steps. The important part is that you don't need to call all of the steps. You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Director\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called director. The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a director class in your programs isn't strictly necessary. You can always call the building steps in a specific order directly from the client code. However, the director class might be a good place to put various construction routines so you can reuse the across your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the director class completely hides the details of product construction from the client code. The client only needs to associate a builder with a director launch the construction with the director, and get the result from builder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "![Class diagram](./images/builder-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicability\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the builder pattern to get rid of a \"telescopic constructor\" (several arguments or overcharge constructor overloading).\n",
    "    * Use the builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create differents representations of some product.\n",
    "    * Use the builder pattern to constructo Composite tree or other complex objects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "    * You can construct objects step by step, defer construction steps or run steps recursively.\n",
    "    * You can use the same construction code when building various representations of products.\n",
    "    * Single Responsability Principle. You can isolate complex construction code from the business login of the product.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "    * The overall complexity of the conde increases since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
