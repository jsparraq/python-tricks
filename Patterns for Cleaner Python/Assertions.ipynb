    "# Covering Your A** With Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter I'm going to give you an introdcution to using assertions in Python. You'll learn how to use them to help automatically detect errors in your Python programs. This will make you programs more reliable and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are meant to be internal self-checks for your program. They work by declaring some conditions as *impossible* in your code. If your program is bug-free, these conditions will never occur. But if the do occur, the program will crash with an assertion error telling you exactly which *impossible* condition was triggered. This makes it much easier to track down and fix bugs in your programs. And I like anything that makes life easier."
