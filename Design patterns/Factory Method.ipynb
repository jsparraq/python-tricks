    "## Factory Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you're creating a logistics management application. The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the *Truck* class\n",
    "\n",
    "After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, most of your code is coupled to the *Truck* class. Adding *Ships* into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Factory Method** patterns suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the *new* operator) with calls to a special *factory* method. Don't worry: the objects are still created via the *new* operator, but it's being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Class diagram](./images/factory-method.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that uses the factory method (ofthe called the client code) doesn't see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract *Transport*. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the *deliver* method, but exactly how it works isn't importante to the client\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "![Class diagram](./images/factory-method-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicability\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Factory Method when\n",
    "\n",
    "    * When you don't know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with\n",
    "    * When you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components\n",
    "    * When you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding the each time\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "    - You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products\n",
    "    - Single responsibility principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program making the code easier to support.\n",
    "    - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing clien code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "    - The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when you're introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes\n",
    "    \n",
