    "## Abstract Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you're creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable\n",
    "    2. Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are avaliable in these \n",
    "    variants: Modern + Victorian + ArtDeco\n",
    "    \n",
    "You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that the match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when the receive non-matching furniture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you don't want to change existing code when adding new products of families of products to the program. Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn't want to change the core code each time it happens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggest is to explicity declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can implement the *Chair* interface; all coffee table variants can implement the *Coffee Table* interface, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next move is to declare the Abstract Factory an interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family (for example, createChair, createSofa and createCoffeeTable). These methods must return abstract product types represented by the interfaces we extracted previously: Chair, Sofa, CoffeeTable and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how about the product variants? For each variant of a product family, we create a separate factory class based on the *AbstractFactory* interface. A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the *ModernFurnitireFactory* can only create *ModernChair*, *ModernSofa* and *ModernCoffeeTable* objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client code has to work with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces. This lets you change the type of a factory that you pass to the client code, as well as the product variant that the client code receives, without breaking the actual client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "![Class diagram](./images/abstract-factory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicability\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the Abstract factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products but you don't want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "    * You can be sure that the products you're getting from a factory are compatible with each other.\n",
    "    * You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.\n",
    "    * Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.\n",
    "    * Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code."
