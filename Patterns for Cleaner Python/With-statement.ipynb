    "The with statement in Python is regarded as an obscure feature by some, But when you peek behind the scenes, you'll see that there's no magic involved, and it's actually a highly useful feature that can gelp you weite cleaner and more readable Python code. It helps simplify some common resource management patterns by abstracting their functionality and allowing them to be factore out and reused.\n",
    "A good way to see this feature used effectively is by looking at examples in the Python standard library. The build-in open() function provides us with an excellent use case:\n"

The *contextlib* utility module in the standard library provides a few more abstractions built on top of the basic context manager protocol.
